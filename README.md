## Getting started
Install the expo app on your phone. After running the 4 or 5 step, a qr code should appear. Use the expo app to scan the qr code to see the mobile app on your phone.

1) `git clone url`
2) `cd citi-hackoverflow-2021_QRapp` (or whatever the cloned folder is called)
3) `npm install`
4) `npm run ios`
5) `npm run android` (I think so)
